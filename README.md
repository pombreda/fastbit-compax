The design space in bitmap index compression is still a fruitful unknown frontier and worth to explore.

We impelement COMPAX2(COMPressed Adaptive indeX) encoding in FastBit as a benchmark for testing our newly designed Bitmap Index compression schemes named SECOMPAX and many others.

SECOMPAX is a new bitmap index encoding algorithm, it is a descent of COMPAX with new designed codebook. SECOMPAX is the abbreviation of Scope-Extended COMPressed Adaptive indeX. In Chinese, it named "展域压缩自适应索引."

For details in COMPAX, please refer to Fusco's work as follows:
